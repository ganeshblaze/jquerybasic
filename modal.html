		  Buzz Aldrin's story takes center stage in "1969: The Second Man," a new theatrical production that explores the life of the second man on the moon.

           Described by Aldrin as a "folk-rock fable for the runner-up in all of us," "1969: The Second Man" explores Aldrin's journey to the moon and what it was like to "come in second." After returning from his historic extraterrestrial exploits, reporters asked Aldrin if he wished he had been the first to land on the moon, and to some people's surprise, he responded, "I didn't really want that because of the added heartache."

          The creators of "1969: The Second Man" seem captivated by Aldrin's contentedness with landing second. They told Space.com in a statement that this production tells this story through the eyes of Aldrin, who became more myth than man after his trip to the moon
